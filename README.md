I built a clean and responsive Spotify web player clone using just HTML and CSS. It captures the look and feel of Spotify’s dark-themed interface, with a sidebar for navigation, sections for playlists, recently played songs, trending songs , Popular Radios , Featured Charts and a music player fixed at the bottom. The design includes cool hover effects, custom icons, and smooth interactions to give it a real app vibe. It’s a frontend-only project that helped me practice layout, flexbox, and UI styling with Google Fonts and Font Awesome.
